### This project was created with React, .Net and Bootsrap. 
## Currently the edit funciton is broken and it is very ugly, but I did my best with my
## limited c# and JS experience and am proud of what I was able to learn and accomplish in just a few days
# I ran the project using VSCode and the dotnet run command
#
# If we wanted to add tags to our contacts, we could create 2 new tables. One that linked Contact Id's to different tag ID's and one that had the actual tags themselves
